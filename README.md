repo containing all modpacks based on the [GDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kcDkGKFbo6yNB5VtB6M7v3FZFFG9SFgv) this repo isnt meant to replace anything, I just wanted to be able to remotely download it with APIs which github lets me do and I dont think google drive does feel free to use and fork to your liking.

Also, read [MODPACKS.md](./MODPACKS.md) if you want to follow the conventions for a manifest for the modpacks.
If you find any innacuracies on the Manifests made for the Modpacks, ie license, author, etc. Make an issue, a PR, or dm @FifthWit on discord
